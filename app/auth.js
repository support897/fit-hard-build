/* Fit App — accounts door (Phase 6).
   NOT LOADED by index.html in the dormant build. This module is
   loaded only after HQ wires this app's own Firebase project and
   pastes the config into accounts-config.js (see
   ACCOUNTS-PHASE-PLAN.md). It uses the Firebase JS SDK as ES
   modules, per the Skills Scout ruling for this desk: no build
   step, no bundler, dormant-gated.
   The door set, as ruled 15 Oct 2026 (programme-wide,
   superseding the 14 Oct §5 shape by her direct word):
   email + a password the user chooses (Firebase Auth),
   beside Google + Apple. The passwordless email link door
   is retired. Apple parks until the Apple Developer
   credential wall clears, like the other apps.
   Data shape (Security desk flag F1, ruled 14 Oct 2026):
   sliced storage WITH a size watch. The root document
   users/{uid} holds only the small slices (profile,
   disclaimer) plus updatedAt. Every other top-level slice
   of the state lives in its own document at
   users/{uid}/slices/{slice}, so no single document can
   reach Firestore's 1 MiB document ceiling while history
   grows; FitLogic.oversizedSlices watches every slice's
   size on save and reports any slice nearing the ceiling.
   Rules live in firestore.rules (owner-only at both levels).
   Merging cloud and device copies is Fit logic
   (FitLogic.mergeStates), which never drops user data. */
