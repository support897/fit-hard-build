/* WALLY the Wombat — Fit Hard guide companion.
   Art: the Innovation Lab's simple-flat make — the art of
   record, ruled by the Lab 14 Oct 2026: WELCOME =
   wally-simple-flat, REST = wally-simple-rest2, ROUGH DAY
   = wally-rough (the three frames on approved board v2).
   Flat shapes, white ground, ONE Wally in every state. His shape never changes; he never gets
   thinner, bigger or fitter. The friend does not change, so
   the user never has to earn him.
   HARD RULES (audience research + Lab pack direction):
   never sad at the user, never disappointed, never a coach;
   rest is his favourite state. Bubbles are short (max 6
   words a line), kind, and carry no dashes. The full Lab
   design pack (more poses + the naming spec) swaps in here
   when it lands; states below map onto the art of record. */
